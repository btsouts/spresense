^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  This sample code gets an image from the image sensor.

  Supported image sensor is ISX012 and will work with the official Spresense camera board.


  This example can be used with the camera example default configuration

  $ ./tools/config.py examples/camera

  This example can also output captured images to an LCD directly.
  If you want to work with LCD devices, configure like this:

  $ ./tools/config.py examples/camera device/lcd

  And enable following option in /sdk/configs/device/camera-defconfig

  CONFIG_EXAMPLES_CAMERA_OUTPUT_LCD=y
  
  Currently supports ili9340 and lpm013m091a based displays.
  
  Default resolution is 320x240.  
  This can be modified in the LCD driver code at /sdk/drivers/lcd/ili9340.c

  The LCD is expected to be connected on SPI4 (expansion board) or SPI5 (main board) 
  
  To use an LCD connected to the expansion board, set the following option in /sdk/configs/device/camera-defconfig
  CONFIG_LCD_ON_EXTENSION_BOARD=y
  
  To use an LCD connected to the main board (the Spresense itself), set the following option in /sdk/configs/device/camera-defconfig
  CONFIG_LCD_ON_MAIN_BOARD=y
  
  The example will capture images to an SD card if one is connected to the expansion board, otherwise it will save to flash memory.
  
  Execute under nsh:

  nsh> camera

  * Display to LCD

  nsh> camera
